### **Slide 4: Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors.
- **Data Transformation:** Normalizing, scaling, encoding categorical data.
- **Data Wrangling:** Merging, reshaping, and filtering datasets.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Use of `fillna()`, `dropna()`, and other strategies to clean data.

---

### **Slide 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- EDA helps understand the underlying structure of the dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, mode, variance, etc.
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, etc.
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are often used for these tasks.
- **Correlation:** Identifying relationships between variables.

---

### **Slide 6: Data Visualization**
- Visualizing data is crucial to understand trends and outliers.
  - **Matplotlib**: Line plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.
  - **Seaborn**: Heatmaps, pair plots, violin plots.
  - **Plotly**: Interactive plots and dashboards.
- Example visualizations:
  - **Histograms:** Distribution of data.
  - **Scatter Plots:** Relationship between two continuous variables.
  - **Box Plots:** Identifying outliers and distribution.

---

### **Slide 7: Statistical Analysis**
- Python offers tools for performing statistical analysis:
  - **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, median, standard deviation.
  - **Inferential Statistics:** Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-squared tests, ANOVA).
  - **Regression Analysis:** Simple and multiple linear regression.
  - **ANOVA and Chi-Square:** Testing relationships between categorical variables.

---

### **Slide 8: Time Series Analysis**
- Time series data involves timestamps and observations over time.
- Techniques:
  - **Decomposition:** Breaking down time series into trend, seasonality, and noise.
  - **Forecasting:** Using models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
  - **Visualization:** Plotting trends and seasonality.
