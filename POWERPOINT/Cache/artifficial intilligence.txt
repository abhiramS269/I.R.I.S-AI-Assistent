### Slide 2: **What is Artificial Intelligence?**
- **Definition:** AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
- **Key Components:** 
  - Machine learning
  - Natural language processing
  - Robotics
  - Computer vision

### Slide 3: **Types of AI**
- **Narrow AI (Weak AI):** Designed to perform a specific task (e.g., facial recognition, voice assistants).
- **General AI (Strong AI):** A hypothetical machine that can understand, learn, and apply intelligence across various tasks, similar to human cognition.
- **Superintelligent AI:** An AI that surpasses human intelligence in every field.

### Slide 4: **How AI Works**
- **Data:** AI models are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns.
- **Algorithms:** AI uses algorithms to process and interpret data.
- **Learning:** 
  - **Supervised Learning:** Training with labeled data.
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Identifying patterns without labeled data.
  - **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through rewards and penalties.

### Slide 5: **Applications of AI**
